# Things that I want to be made or can't find
- [ ] Engine knock analyser - User would place a phone on a car hood, press a button to analyze engine idle, and get info on the engine, problems, recommendations.
- [ ] OSS clone of https://pingendo.com/ which generates sites with no JS
- [ ] Powerful linux USB media/formatting tool (like Rufus) 
- [ ] Alternative `make` implementation with better performance and debug tools
- [ ] Package manager for shared libraries and headers for all ABIs (not code)
